A frontend application for 'Dexhune : NFT Hotswap'. 

! General ! 
The app allows users to create new hotswap LPs, or insert an existing hotswap LP address and either swap for it - add liquidity - claims fees on liquidity positions or withdraw their liquidity.

1a ;  Wallet connect

1b ;  DXH Logo 

1c ; Address field ;
Allows the user to insert a listing address to interact with. 

1d ; Add button ; 
Begins interacting with the stated listing address.

1e ; Factory Contract Link ;
Sends the user to an etherscan URL where the factory is deployed. 

1f ; Github link

1g ; Trade menu.

1h ; price ;
Queries the stated hotswap controller, fetches the price, decimals and name, normalizes decimals, stores the value. 

Examples; price is 100000000000000000000, with 18 decimals that is 100. Stores the data as 100 [FFT name] to 1 [NFT name]. 


1i; Amount Field ;
Allows the user to state a number of NFTs to buy or sell. 

1j ; Buy/sell toggle ;
Determines if the swap is for buy or sell.

1k ; slippage field ; 
determines how much is set in "minOutput" or "maxInput" in 1m. 

1l ; Cost/settlement display ;
Shows how much [FFT] the swap will cost or settle.
 
For buys this is gotten by calculating; 

Swap amount * price = initial input
Initial input / 100 * slippage percent = added input
added input + initial input = cost 

For sells this is gotten by first calculating impact price; 

NFT swap amount * price = FFT output 
FFT Liquidity - FFT output = FFT impact 
NFT Liquidity + NFT swap amount = NFT impact 
FFT impact / NFT impact = impact price 

Then using impact price to determine settlement; 

Swap amount * impact price = initial output 
Initial output / 100 * slippage percent = lost output
initial output - lost output = settlement 


1m ; Swap button ;
(Presents a popup to approve the NFT or FFT for trade if not already approved)
Pushes a transaction to execute the swap with the stated details. 

Slippage setting is determined for buys as; 

amount * price = swap input
swap input / 100 * slippage = delta
swap input + delta =  maxInput

Slippage setting is determined for sells as; 

NFT swap amount * price = FFT output
NFT swap amount / NFT Liquidity * 100 = impact percent 
FFT output / 100 * (slippage + impact percent) = delta
FFT output - delta =  minOutput

"slippage" is the number set in the slippage field on 1k.

2a ; Liquidity menu

2b ; Amount field 

2c ; FFT or NFT toggle ; 
Determines if the user is depositing the target NFT or FFT in the listing. 

2d ; Deposit button ; 
Displays a pop-up for the user to approve the FFT or NFT if enough is not approved for deposit, if already approved then it pushes a transaction for deposit using the details provided. 

2e ; Positions panel ; 
Returns all liquidity positions the user has, first shows the amount, if greater than 99999 then it displays as 1.0e5. Shows the token ticker up to 4 letters, more than 4 is displayed as "XXXX...". lastly it displays the amount of fees collected and unclaimed, if claimed this returns "N/A".  

Unclaimed fees are calculated by using the following formula from the hotswap contracts specifications; 

tVolume - dVolume = cVolume 

cVolume / tVolume = volume ratio 

volume ratio * total fees  = fees accrued 

NFT or FFT Alloc  / Total FFT or NFT Liquidity = Liquidity contribution 

(selects based on deposit type)

fees accrued * liquidity contribution = unclaimed fees 

2f ; Claim fees button ;
Pushes a transaction to claim fees on a given liquidity position. 

2g ; Withdraw button ;
Pushes a transaction to withdraw the target liquidity position. 

2h ; scroll bar

2i ; Close button ; 
returns the user to the landing page.

3d ; List button ;
Pushes transaction to list the addresses set in "NFT Address" and "FFT Address", sets "0.001" in the payable field.

/// Notes ///
- Price is only fetched once the page is loaded or after a transaction occurs. 

- NFTs use "setApprovalForAll' to approve a token for trading.
