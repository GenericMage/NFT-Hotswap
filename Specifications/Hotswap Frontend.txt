A frontend application for 'Dexhune : NFT Hotswap'. 

! General !
The app allows users to insert a hotswap LP address and either swap for it - add liquidity - claims fees on liquidity positions or withdraw their liquidity. 

The Plebbit token (PLEB) is set as a default, the app fetches the prices of PLEB - Exo's Bagholders NFT (xPLEB) and the bridged version of Plebbit Token (wPLEB). Using this information to present the relative prices of PLEB and wPLEB, thus facilitating arbitrage.

(Only visible if the token being traded is xPLEB), 
This display has (3) operations that occur only once when the app is loaded. 

Op1 :

This fetches the LP pair for PLEB on ETH mainnet and determines the PLEB to ETH price, then fetches the ETH to USD price and determines the PLEB price to USD. 

Presents the PLEB to USD price. 

Op2 :

This fetches the xPLEBs to ETH floor price on OpenSea, converts it to USD then fetches the wPLEB to xPLEB price and converts it to USD, thus presenting a USD price for wPLEB.    

example; 
xPLEB on OpenSea is 0.001ETH, in USD this is $3.226. 

If there is 10,000,000 wPLEB in the hotswap LP while there is 10 xPLEB, this is wPLEB / xPLEB = 1,000,000 wPLEB to 1 xPLEB. 

Now the important part; if one xPLEB on OpenSea is $3.226 the app calculates; 3.226 / 1,000,000 = 0.000003226.

Thus the wPLEB price is $0.000003226. 

Op3 :

xPLEB price is presented as well, by first dividing the amount of wPLEB in the hotswap LP with the amount of xPLEB. 

example; 10,000,000 wPLEB / 10 xPLEB = 1,000,000 wPLEB to 1 xPLEB. 

The exact USD price is gotten by using the price of PLEB from the first operation, So if the PLEB price is $0.000008, then the xPLEB price is; $8. 

Note; this specifically uses PLEB price and not wPLEB. 

***

All prices are displayed as;

$8.0e-6 PLEB , 

$3.2e-6 wPLEB, 

$8 xPLEB.

- More volume = more fees = more LP providers = more demand.
