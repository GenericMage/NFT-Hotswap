# NFT Hotswap

An NFT Liquidity protocol based on Dexhune-P (Marker Foundry). Allows anyone to create liquidity pools for pairing ERC-20s with ERC-721s. Will be deployed to Polygon MATIC, the first NFT collection will be "Exo's PLEBs" and the first ERC-20 will be a bridged version of Plebbit token.
